# RobloxServerJoinerMk2
This is a W.I.P script that allows you to go to any roblox server locale of your choosing. Originally made by Exilon24.

## Installation:
Open your terminal and move to the directory you wish to install this tool and clone this repo: git clone https://github.com/TheConfusedlol/RobloxServerJoinerMk2.git

Then cd into the installed directory and run pip install -r requirements.txt

The program requires some settings to be set. Open up roServerFinder.py in a text editor (notepad, vim, anything really). There are 2 fields you need to set (starting line 7):

## Enter your roblox cookie here
``` robloxCookie = "" ```

## Enter desired city and region here (Florida used as an example)
```
targetCity = "miami"
targetRegion = "florida"
targetCountryCode = "US"
```

Make sure to save your changes before running the script.

## Addendum: Handling Cities Without States
When specifying a city and region, it's important to note that not all cities are associated with a state or province. For cities like Tokyo or London, which are major urban centers and not part of a state system, you can follow this format:
``` 
Enter desired city and region here
targetCity = "tokyo"          # For cities without a state, use the city name only
targetRegion = ""              # Leave this blank if the city does not have a state
targetCountryCode = "JP"      # Use the appropriate country code (e.g., "JP" for Japan, "UK" for the United Kingdom)
```
## Usage
Then go to the directory roServerFinder.py is in and run python roServerFinder.py and enter the game ID e.g: https://www.roblox.com/games/15069312471/LifeLike-Disasters game ID is 15069312471

This will open a browser window, requesting to join a roblox game. It will prompt you to allow roblox to open. If you decline, roblox will not open. The browser window will automatically close after you join.
# Safety
I understand that it can be concerning to give your Roblox security information to a random piece of code from the internet. I want to assure you that this script will not hack your account. It's designed solely to help you join the servers you want to play on.
